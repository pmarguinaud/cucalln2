MODULE YOE_SPECTRAL_PLANCK

! YOE_SPECTRAL_PLANCK
!
! PURPOSE
! -------
!   Calculate Planck function integrated across user-specified
!   spectral intervals, used in RADHEATN by approximate longwave
!   update scheme to modify longwave fluxes to account for the
!   spectral emissivity on the high-resolution model grid (rather than
!   the lower resolution grid seen by the radiation scheme).
!
! INTERFACE
! ---------
!   Call the INIT member routine to configure the look-up table of the
!   TSPECRALPLANCK type, followed by any number of CALC calls with the
!   temperatures at which the Planck function is required. FREE then
!   deallocates memory.
